          A self-taught developer who started in January 2017 and transitioned from a full-time Pharmacist role. I'm looking to work on exciting new projects, with a great team, and seize opportunities to grow.
          In the past, I have completed paid freelance web projects, worked remotely with a team called Chingu-Voyage, and organized for a Free Code Camp local group.
